## Storage Techs

### Random Access Memory

- **SRAM (static RAM)**
  - for cache memories
  - both _on_ and _off_ CPU chip
  - more expensive
  - **bistable**
- **DRAM (dynamic RAM)**
  - main memory
  - frame buffer of a graphic system
  - stores each bit as charge on a capacitor
  - _very_ sensitive to any disturbance
- **memory controller**
- **VRAM**
  - allows concurrent reads & writes to the memory
- Nonvolatile Memory

### Disk

- takes _million times_ longer than reading from SRAM
- Logical Disk Blocks
  - **disk controller**

## Locality

- Reference data items that:
  - are near other recently referenced data items, or
  - were recently referenced themselves
- Two distinct forms:
  - **temporal locality**
  - **spatial locality**
- **cache memory**

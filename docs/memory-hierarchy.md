## Storage Techs

### Random Access Memory

- **SRAM (static RAM)**
  - for cache memories
  - both _on_ and _off_ CPU chip
  - more expensive
  - **bistable**
- **DRAM (dynamic RAM)**
  - main memory
  - frame buffer of a graphic system
  - stores each bit as charge on a capacitor
  - _very_ sensitive to any disturbance
- **memory controller**
- **VRAM**
  - allows concurrent reads & writes to the memory
- Nonvolatile Memory
